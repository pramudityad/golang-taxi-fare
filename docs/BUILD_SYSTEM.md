## Build Targets

### Development Workflow
```bash
make dev          # Complete development workflow
make build        # Build for current platform  
make test         # Run all tests
make clean        # Clean artifacts
```

### Testing
```bash
make test-unit         # Unit tests only
make test-coverage     # Tests with coverage
make test-race         # Race condition detection
make test-integration  # Integration tests
make benchmark         # Performance benchmarks
```

### Cross-Platform Builds
```bash
make build-linux      # Linux AMD64
make build-darwin     # macOS AMD64  
make build-windows    # Windows AMD64
make build-all        # All platforms
```

### Code Quality
```bash
make fmt       # Format code
make vet       # Static analysis
make lint      # Linting
make check     # All quality checks
```

### Validation
```bash
make validate  # Complete validation suite
```

## Test Runner Script

The `scripts/test-runner.sh` provides comprehensive test execution:

```bash
./scripts/test-runner.sh all          # Full test suite
./scripts/test-runner.sh unit         # Unit tests only
./scripts/test-runner.sh coverage     # Coverage analysis
./scripts/test-runner.sh race         # Race detection
./scripts/test-runner.sh integration  # Integration tests
./scripts/test-runner.sh benchmark    # Performance tests
./scripts/test-runner.sh quality      # Code quality
./scripts/test-runner.sh platform     # Platform compatibility
./scripts/test-runner.sh performance  # Performance validation
```

## Usage Examples

### Development Cycle
```bash
# Start development
make clean
make deps

# Write code...

# Validate changes
make validate

# Full development workflow
make dev
```
